= VMWare specific environment

== Access to vSphere

In order for machine config operator to interact with the vSphere API, we need to expose the endpoint to the Openshift nodes.

In vSphere, you can add a total of 4 network adapters on the appliance. Second adapter will be earmarked for VCHA, so if needed you have to add an additional adapter to configure.

Make sure that the hostname specified to access vCenter, resolves within the subnet as the ip address specified on the third adapter.

NOTE: VMware VCSA 7 multiple network adapters https://4sysops.com/archives/vmware-vcsa-7-multiple-network-adapters/
